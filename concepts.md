Seals:
- Seals fill out a Principle; each Seal Tree lives inside an Aspect of the Principle
- Seals can gate you into a thing that is not really a Seal as such
  - Eg Sorcerous Initiation Seals, Necromantic Initiation Seals, Martial Arts Seals, Astrology Seals, ...

Chosen Seals:
- The Principles all had to be things compatible with Humans
- Each Exaltation Type could only fit one Principle
  - Attributes - Lunars
  - Abilities - Solars, Abyssals
  - Backgrounds - Sidereals
    - Eg Resources, Status, Face etc...
  - Action Types/Roles/States - Dragonblooded
    - Eg the Injured Seal tree, the Combat Seal tree, the Joining Battle Seal tree, the Mass Combat Seal tree, the Downtime Seal tree, the Group Action Seal tree, the Aid Another Seal tree...
  - Equipment - Alchemicals
    - Eg Weapons, Armour, Vehicles, Accoutrements, Tools, Factories, Lockpicks, Paperwork
  - The Infernals are interesting because they were opened up to Seals from the Principles of a number of Yozi.

Principles connect to/are Shinma. Primordial Shinma, Twisted Shinma, Dead Shinma, and Lesser Shinma.

The Loom of Fate is connected to the Stars. There are no Stars in Malfeas, and any Stars in a Waypoint are completely local to it.

Creation's wake/the echoes left by the clash of Shinma/powerful enough acts of Shaping leave marks that show up in waygates in the Wyld.

Fate vs predetermination - anything that is predetermined will happen, but predetermination is a lot looser than 'Fate'.
Eg you are fated as a mortal to be killed by a group of Chosen, but instead you kill them. You defied Fate, but it was predetermined that if the meeting happened, it would end in killing.
Defying Fate is an extraordinary action for anyone who is not a Chosen.

Extraordinary actions vs ordinary actions
- Extraordinary action consume stunts, ordinary actions are boosted (eg, they get dice bonus plus a kicker) by stunts
- Eg crafting usable tools out of random detritus is an extraordinary action, which usually consumes points worth of valid stunts equal to the square of the level of the tool
- But, you could have a Seal that makes construction of usable tools out of random detritus an ordinary action, as long as you meet some condition
- Flipping Fate to an alternate interpretation is 
- Some charms expand what a stunt can do - eg Lightning Cutting Blade is a permanent Solar Charm that lets you block unblockable effects like lightning bolts or lasers with a two+ point stunt, Heavenly Defence is a permanent solar melee charm which allows 3 dice stunts to parry unparryable effects like avalanches etc

The Unbound/Free, The Bound/Broken, The Buried/Murdered
The Unshaped/Unbidden

Flaws of Perfection
- Any 'Perfect' ability must have several 'flaws of Perfection' that stop it from working. These flaws come in specific types and layers.

The necessary vs the accident. Or, the essence vs the dross. Primordials were initially bundles of aspects bound together loosely in the spaces between stories that were made up of seals. They gained the 'dross' of forms after. Humans are made of dross, and can be Chosen to have seals after. This means that Primordials are much more bound to their Principles, as their dross serves the Principle, and only the friction between their Aspects gives them any real slack - that is, their dice come almost exclusively from Aspect bound dice adders, and their dross is usually pretty limited in how it can accumulate dice otherwise. Wheras for humans, even once they are Chosen, their dross is not bound to a single Principle.

Fighting stuff:

Draws and Feints
Binds, Beats, and disengages
Martial arts vs Melee as two actually different ways to structure combat (eg the gems vs plays, even down to eg different timing rules).

'Existence' instead of 'Essence'.
